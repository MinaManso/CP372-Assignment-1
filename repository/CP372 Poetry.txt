In CP372, I find my way,
Where packets dance and routers play.
With every byte and every frame,
I learn the art of this vast game.

Professor Rudafshani leads the charge,
Her wisdom makes the tough parts large,
Seem simple, clear, and full of light—
Networking dreams take off in flight.

From IPs to protocols, layer by layer,
I grasp each concept with utmost care.
With wires and waves, connections bloom,
In Masoomeh’s class, there’s always room.

For love of networks, my heart’s aflame,
In this course, I’ve found my aim.
With every ping and traceroute trace,
I feel the pulse of the digital space.
